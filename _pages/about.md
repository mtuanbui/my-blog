<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an artificial intelligence researcher with a primary focus on researching and developing deep learning models in the field of computer vision. My work spans large-scale models, such as text-to-image diffusion models, and lightweight solutions like real-time light estimation models. A curated selection of the projects I have undertaken can be found on the [Projects subpage](/my-blog/projects).

Before dedicating myself fully to deep learning, I pursued research in computer graphics and image processing, earning a PhD in the field. Some of my work has been published in the reputable journal Computers & Graphics, accessible at the [Publications subpage](/my-blog/publications/).

This website also serves as a [blog](/my-blog/blog) where I share my notes and insights on topics related to machine learning and deep learning.
