abstract = {In this study, we propose a novel and efficient method to generate 3D-look shade illustrations from simple sketches having outlines and hatching strokes. The basic idea is to use the contours and hatching strokes specified by a designer as a metaphor for constructing a normal field for 3D-look shading effects. The overall shape of a 3D object is depicted with contours, such as silhouette contours and feature contours related to geometric ridges and valleys. The shading effects are achieved by means of hatching strokes, which are usually along the principal directions of the object׳s local geometry. In our system, users first sketch an object׳s outline and can draw a set of hatching strokes over its interior regions. Next, the system estimates the 3D normals of the points on the contours and hatching strokes. A smooth normal field is then generated by interpolating the estimated normals with the diffusion processes. In addition, our system provides an intuitive method for adjusting normal transitions from edited to untouched regions using an alpha map. Finally, the texture coordinates of each pixel belonging to the drawn objects are computed based on the normal vector field so that the objects can be rendered in various 3D-look shadings, with changes for different materials and lighting. Experimental results show that our system can easily and effectively generate illustrations having 3D-look shading effects from various 2D sketches drawn by users.},

abstract = {We developed an interactive modeling tool for constructing a height field from the cross contours in a line drawing, added to provide an illusion of depth. Our approach places no specific constraints on the artist and can handle freely drawn shapes with partially structured or partially connected cross contours. In our system, the user first draws cross contours across the interior boundaries of the object. The system then extracts the intersection points of the contours and derives 2D polygons by connecting consecutive intersection points with straight lines. These 2D polygons are treated as the projection of a polygonal surface approximating the shape of the object. The 3D edge vectors and 3D normals of the approximated polygon surface are then estimated while considering the perceptions of the viewer and the goals of the designer. Based on the relative height values obtained from the 3D edge vectors and the co-planarities of the curve segments, a height field is generated in the image space that reasonably matches the cross contours of the input drawing. Experimental results demonstrated the ability of the system to generate height fields from a wide range of cross contours. We also showed that our system can be used to apply lighting effects to sketches and allows local shape deformation based on the constructed height field.},
